Key Findings 
Surprisingly, Canada’s market for Data Science and Analysis does not require formal education, but perhaps more professional designations.  This is unlike the international market that requires formal education with tendency to require more Master’s degrees. 
There is a slight increase in tendency for hiring female D.S (although insignificant).
Surprisingly, Canadian market appeals more to R and SAS than the International market appealing to python. 
The international market most fitted age groups of DS is (45-65), while Canada’ s age group is (25-44). 
There is a positive association between career switching and job employment.
Social Science is the least to be hired internationally as DS, and natural science is the least in Canada.
